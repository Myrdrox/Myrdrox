- 👋 Hi, I’m @Myrdrox aka Chris
- 👀 I’m interested in ... well.. i guess riding my motorcycle is the only thing interesting me atm.
- 🌱 I was looking into Web3, DeFi and therefor Solidity for a few months before starting to get involved in Solidity, smart contracts and so on. Pretty hard doing it at the same time as paramedic school, it`s possible though.
- 💞️ First I am trying to get a hold of all this. For em it`s a completely new line of "work", so there is an uncountable amount of stuff to find out right now. This is overwhelming and interesting at the same time. 
- 📫 Send your pigeon or a telegram
